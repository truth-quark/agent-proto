Features to add/consider for the agent simulation
-------------------------------------------------

Code cleanup? for-else or while-else loops to clean up logic?

Expand vision to allow for up to 4-6 cells of view
Update chosen direction to be weighted based on vision (possibly use Gallant's circle code to make a direction based on weighted view 'wedge' - possibly too complicated)
Add water to the environment (eg. small streams=1, river join cell=sum of previous)
Add topo to the environment
Add memory: recall up to X coords (in LRU cache) of high value cells (food, water) OR give each agent a networkx/tree structure to remember good cells/routes taken. Use that to optimise for taking a shorter path between places of interest (will be of more use when agents require different types of resources)

Add in travel difficulty to cells: steeper/vegetated cells require more energy to move across
Pollution and semi permanent depletion of cells?
Trade food & water?
Measure which cells see the most traffic/become paths
Measure length of life [young|    adult      | elderly]
Add clans / family: young agents tail parents until a specific age


Search mechanisms:
* Add 'intelligent' search: find water by going downwards to find streams
* Upwards to climb peaks and get a better view of surrounding area (eg. double or triple the vision when on a peak cell to locate food)


Other simulations:
* More detailed simulation of daily activities (leave shelter, get water, find food, mind + feed child agents, return to shelter)
* Aboriginal hunter gatherer? Don't stockpile resources, leave some behind, try to focus on longevity of the environment
* Seasonal changes and weather? Less growth over winter, see how that affects population. Drought: make rivers shrink


Urban Microsimulation
---------------------

Possible things to track:
* Waste (household -> recycling and to landfill. Sewerage, rainwater? How does it affect pollution elsewhere?)
* Transport (choice options: walk, ride, drive, bus)  Relation to hills, distance, fitness
  Use networkx as part of transport systems/roads to measure/simulate congestion etc?
* Water consumption
* Energy use (Transport, in the home, in offices)
* Map to obesity, alienation from areas, lack of transport options

For the purposes of what? Measure overall effects of housing design, larger impacts from cities/dev, city design effects, energy flows, effects on people, effects on the environment â†’ maybe try and get some kind of holistic sustainability model incorporating several different factors. Give overall rating of impacts. Problems: complex and could involve a lot of factors. Would have to combine simpler smaller models.




Other Thoughts
--------------

Coordinate class for cleaner code. Could add adjacent cells as a method?

class Coordinate2D(object):
    def __init__(self, y, x):
        # TODO: slots
        self.y = y
        self.x = x

    def offset(self, yoff, xoff):
        """Return (y,x) tuple coordinate of that offset"""
        return (self.y + yoff, self.x + xoff)

    def update(self, yoff, xoff):
        """Update coordinate with an offset"""
        self.y += yoff
        self.x += xoff

    # TODO: possible idea, call obj to return coords
    def __call__(self):
        return (self.y, self.x)
